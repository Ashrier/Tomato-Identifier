# Tomato-Identifier
Identifies different stages of growth throughout the Heirloom Tomato life cycle.
After this project, I plan on making machine learning algorithms for grain producting plants such as Semi Dwarf Wheat varaties, Oat, Barley, etc..

This project is a prototype towards a larger idea I wish to help see to fruition.

I would like to see more plant factories with artifical lighting (PFAL's) built around the world and I would like to help automate them with robotics, sensors, and machine learning.

Most of my information will be coming from the book "Plant Factory, An Indoor Vertical Farming System for Efficient Quality Food Production" edited by: Toyoki Kozai, Genhua Niu, and Michiko Takagaki

Plant Factories are fully enclosed artificial environments that are used to provide an optimum habitat for growing vegetation. 
Important Features of a plant factory.
1. Airtight.
2. Air Shower- Hot water shower, culture & operation rooms.
3. Muliple tiers with lighting system and hydroponic beds.
4. Air conditionded for cooling(even though modern PFAL's are built with LED's, they give off a lot of heat) - de-humidifying(the plants respiration and water loss from hydroponics can oversaturate the air), and air circulation for respiration/photosyntehsis cycle.
5. CO2 enrichment to keep concentration at 1000ppm. 
6. Floor covered in epoxy resin (usually) easy to maintain a clean enviroment and avoids water leakage from damageing concrete foundation.
7. Collection & re-use system of water condensed at AC.
8. Circulation & Sterilization system for nutrient solution supply. (usually UV light and some physical filter)

With these features, a plant factory has some amazing efficient features. 
1. A PFAL can be built anywhere because soil and sunlight is not a consideration for growth potential. 
2. The growing environment is not affected by the outside environment.
3. Production can be year round and is over 100x more productive than traditional field agriculture.
4. More control over micro and phytonutrients in the produce through the manipulation of lighting systems and nutrients in the hydroponics.
5. Produce is pesticide and herbicide free (no need to wash produce before eating)
6. No fertilizer run off (not eutrophication of rivers, lakes, and oceans)
7. Energy spent on transportation can be reduced if built close to urban centers. 
8. High resource use efficiency
9. Upwards of 95-98% less water use thanks to water reclimation system. Water that is not absorbed by the plants gets recycled (until  a new nutrient solution needs to be made) and the water transpired by the plant is caught in the air circulation system and captured. The 5-2% that is lost is from opening and closing doors to the PFAL.

I am hoping to build a plant identifier that can recognize the different stages of growth through a plants life. To also automate a robotic system and paired with Machine learning to lessen the physical labor involved in preparing culture, operation, and packaging rooms, and to help with pollinating flowers for fruit production. 
Wheat yield potential in controlled-environment vertical farms

In one paper it is estimated that if you have a one hectare sized PFAL with 10 vertical layers, annually you can grow 700±40 tons/hectare to 1,940±230 tons/hectare a year as apposed to current field production of 3.2 tons/hectare(citation 1). Growing upwards of 220-600 times the amount of vegetation while using less water, no pesticides or herbicides, and no eutrophication of excess fertilizer.

Let's take Illinois for example. 75% (27 million acres) of the land in Illinois is farmland with most farms being for corn(54%), soybean(27%), or livestock(13%) and accounts for $19 billion annually(citation 2). Illinois timberland accounts for 13.4% of the land use and accounts $16-23 billion annually (citation3). It may be difficult to convert PFAL's suitible for growing corn because they can grow (depending on the variety) 5-8ft in height. That takes a lot of vertical space, so a building, to have 10 tiers of grow medium, you would need to have around 60-90ft of height and the lighting system would need to be able to reach higher intesities to reach the lower leaves for photosysnthesis. You would also need more reflective material on the sides. Where if you grow soy beans, the building could be around 25-30ft in height. Semi-Dwarf wheat varieties stand as tall as 2.5 feet, so a building would also be around 30 feet in height. 

But if you replaced all corn and soybean field agriculture with PFAL's(assuming the same growth of 220-600x yeild in PFAL's as the assumed wheat production), we are looking at a decrease from 21.87 million acres of land for agriculture down to  6.1-5.1 million acres used for field agriculture. Freeing up, essentially 22-21 million acres of land for other use. Like restoring it to timberland. Growing much more timber, freeing up more land for living on, capturing and sequesturing more carbon, increases the quality of water as herbicide, pesticide, and fertilizer run off decreases. Increasing the quantity of water as the state will need to use 5-3% of the amount of water on agriculture as it did before. 

But converting to PFAL's comes with many challenges. 
Challenges being:
1. Resources to build the PFAL's. The computers to run and automate the system. The lighting system. The specialized sensors.
2. Labor to build and then maintain. Highly trained technicians and engineers.
3. Energy to run the system (with better renewables, I have hope they can be self sufficient in that regard.)
4. Many many many more. But those are the big 3. Resources, Labor/Training, Energy.
